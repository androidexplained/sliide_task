# Sliide Android developer challenge 

## Description
Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish writing unit tests therefore I do not consider this production ready.
I think should have focused on writing unit tests after implementation of every feature rather than getting to it at the end.

As it is the main functionality should be working
* view last page of users
* remove individual users
* add users

Since I only had 3 hours (I think I spent a bit more, more like 4) there are things that I would improve

Things to be still done:
* proper DI as in the project I'm using simple constructor injection (didn't want to get lost in dagger setup because of the time-frame)
* unit tests for Repository, UseCase & ViewModel (I've started working on the ViewModel test but wasn't able to finish, damn RxJava unit testing :D)
* UI tests going through each feature
* polish the UI because it's kind of rough

After all I think I enjoyed working on the test, thanks guys!
